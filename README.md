# timecrack --back end api
Software to crack the TODO list, worklog, and time tracking problem

## api is built using flask

## Why another time tracking application?
1. Because I need one that is all inclusive
2. I need to be able to add features when I want
3. I wanted to develop an opensource project


## What are the main features of this project
1. Everything starts with a Project
2. Projects have goals and objectives
3. Goals and objectives have tasks and sub tasks
4. granular time tracking to the sub task level
5. detailed notes at each level project, goals, task and subtask
6. the notes are timestamped and are a worklog, and will curated into a daily digest
7. all time dedicated to each sub-level rolls up into the upper level
